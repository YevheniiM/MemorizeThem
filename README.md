# MemorizeThem

> There is no such thing as a 'self-made' man. We are made up of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, or spoken one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the make-up of our character and of our thoughts, as well as our success.

### About MemorizeThem
The main goal of my web application is to keep your **circle of friends** up to date. Always **be in touch** with people that you know and never forgot such things as birth date or some facts from their lives.

If you aren't sure in whether do you need this app or not: just think about your **social connections**. How much friends you have? 50? 200? 500? Do you remember all information about them? In what spheres they work? Or how many children they have? Whatever. With MemorizeThem you will know all this facts - the only thing that you need is desire.

Predictable question is "Why I should write all these facts about my **connetions**? And I have very simple answer - **to be connected**!

### Google Contacts API

My web application uses the latest version of Google Contacts API.

The Google Contacts API allows client applications to view and update a user's contacts. Contacts are stored in the user's Google Account; most Google services have access to the contact list.

Your client application can use the Google Contacts API to create new contacts, edit or delete existing contacts, and query for contacts that match particular criteria

- **MemorizeThem** (the main application, which controls everything, includes basic urls and settings)
